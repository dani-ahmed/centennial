    <h1>PROMISED LAND</h1>
    <h5>
        Oprah Winfrey’s house, named “The Promised Land,” is located
        in Montecito, CA. Inside the approximately 23,000 sq. ft. Neo-Georgian
        style mansion, there are six bedrooms, 14 bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen
        and wine cellar, library, theater, and 10 fireplaces. Interestingly enough,
        it doesn’t appear that there is a swimming pool in the backyard, which is
        a very common addition to any California mansion.
