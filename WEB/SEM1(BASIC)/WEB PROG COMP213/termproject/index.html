                "We were so fortunate to have found Punch Sockalingam
                when we moved to Toronto. As our Realtor, he
                helped us find the right house in the right
                neighborhood for the right price. He was patient
                as we traveled from Ohio to look at homes
                over several months and cautioned us about making
                unreasonable offers when we fell too quickly for overpriced
                homes"

            <blockquote>
                "I recently had the pleasure of working with
                Punch when looking for my home. From day 1,
                Punch showed homes to view based on what I was looking for. All throughout
                the negotiations and closing Punch was there quickly
                handling any issues that may have risen. If the time ever comes
                when I will be looking for a new home, there isn't any question
                on who my Realtor will be!"
